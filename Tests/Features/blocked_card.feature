Feature: Block Cards with Too High a Balance
  In order to prevent patrons from accumulating too many fines and still borrowing more materials

  Note: The balance threshold to block a card is currently $10, but that should be configurable.

  # Scenario: Some balance is ok

  # Scenario: Block cards with balance over the limit
